# scorecard
An electronic scorecard for a RC tank clue game.
#### What? A game? Nobody plays them these days!
Well this one is fun. It's online, fast, modern, multiplayer, and installable.
#### Fine, how do I play?
Basically you'll need this to setup:

- Some kind of RC truck/car/tank
- Some ribbon or something
- A pegboard
- Little adapters. Basically the bottom of them goes in to the pegboard, and the top has a slit for a ribbon. I recommend using a 3D printer and designing with TinkerCAD.
- Some paper + scissors + writing utensil

Okay, now:

- Put the pegs in to the pegboard, and use the ribbon to create a maze. Leave an entry point.  
- Make some cards from A1-D4 (A1, A2, A3, A4, ... C4, D1, D2, D3, D4) by cutting the paper in to small rectangles/squares and writing the card number with the marker. Scatter them across the maze.  
- Get your friends ready, make sure every one of them has the maze set up, and get them to go to https://tank-scorecard.herokuapp.com/. The first visitor will probably have a slow loading time, because the app has to wake up, but eventually it'll load. Also, this is best on a [Zoom](https://zoom.us) call.  
- Open the scorecard. Tap on "Let's do this", tap on the name field and enter your name, and tap on "Let's do this" again.
- Share your user ID with your friends, so they can add you to their group. If anyone shares their user ID, anybody who adds themself will be added to a group with that person, that person's group, them, and their group.
- Enter in your clue ID and check it. If it's right, enter in the correct target number, and share it!

#### This is confusing.
Well you know that wasn't my intention. Try [emailing me because I'm too lazy to check anywhere else.](mailto:k.i.d.s.coding.pl.ace+onlinestuff@gmail.com)
#### Hey, why do we need to do a video call? We can meet in person now!
Well we caught a big virus and everyone had to stay home, at the time of writing.
